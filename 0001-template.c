 * thus, my code will be rely on others' code, and what I need to do
 * is learn the usage of the intefaces, I don't like it, I don't like 
 * a program language which has many intefaces and features we can invoke,
 * I want to do anything I want to do, intefaces and features are not 
 * flexible. So I give up anything and chose C and kernel.
