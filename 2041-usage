1:	the meaning of the four-character-number prefix:

	1234:	example of a prefix.
		123:	main index of each file.
			1:	the type of each file:
				0->	c and h files
				1->	script
				2->	MIME files.
				...	not defined yet.
		4:	the version of each file, for the last number:
			(4 is in fact hardly to happen here.)
			0->	test version. 
			1->	steady version.
			2->	version 2.
			...

2:	to make sure that the Makefiles can work:

	make sure that ../bin/ exists.
	better add ../bin to PATH. (edit ~/.bashrc)
    	modify Makefile.config and change SOURCECODE when to compile new code.

3:	file description:
	
	script-prepare.sh:	namely prepare in ../bin/. 
		
		Command:
			eg. 
		
			prepare 0021 (0021 should be unique in this folder.)
			
			then 0021-quick-sort.c will be write to Makefile.config1,
			then one can use Makefile to build it, install it.

			prepare quick-sort can also work.
